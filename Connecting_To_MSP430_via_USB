Follow these instructions to modify your USB driver.  This will allow you
to connect to the MSP430 without any trouble in Linux:

1. Download the cdc-acm source code for your linux distribution.
   --> Google if you don't know how
   --> If you are running linux 2.6.35-32, I have attached the modified
      source code that you need.  So just copy this code to the folder 
      specified in the next step.

2. Once you have the source code copy the cdc-acm driver source to your headers
   folder like this:

     # cp [cdc-acm source] /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/drivers/usb/class/.

3. Now modify the following lines:

      In the function "static void acm_port_down(...)":
         - Find the line starting with "acm_set_control(...)" comment out
           that line like this:
         
            //acm_set_control(acm, acm->ctrlout = 0);

      In the function "static int acm_tty_open(...)"
         - Find the line starting with "if (0 > acm_set_control(..." comment
           the entire if statement out like this:

            /*if (0 > acm_set_control(acm, acm->ctrlout = ACM_CTRL_DTR | ACM_CTRL_RTS) &&
               (acm->ctrl_caps & USB_CDC_CAP_LINE))
                  goto full_bailout;*/

4. Now go ahead and compile this driver with the following command as root:

   # cd /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/
   # make modules M=drivers/usb/class
   # make modules_install M=/drivers/usb/class

5. Reboot your computer and your MSP430 should have no trouble connecting to
your machine.
