This project was for EE 521 final project.  This tarball contains the following
code:

> Base Station code (written in java)
   - Requires the RXTX serial library found at http://rxtx.qbang.org/
   - Requires that the MSP430 be assosiated with a device named /dev/ttyS* where
     the star must be replaced with a number
      > this can be done using a soft link like this:
         sudo ln -s /dev/ttyACM0 /dev/ttyS33
> Helicopter code
   - RF communication
   - UART communication
   - PWM code on the MSP430
> Repeater
   - UART communication between base station and MSP430
   - RF communication

All the C code in this tarball should be compiled with the gcc msp430 
cross-compiler.  The msp430 compiler is included in this tarball with
instructions on how to install it.

The Base station requires a special serial communications library called
RXTXcomm.  The JAR is included here: 
   "base_station/basestation/serialcomm/rxtxcomm.jar"
The library can also be found at http://rxtx.qbang.org/ along with support for
installing the library, usage of the library, and examples.  Basically, for
linux you need to copy the librxtxSerial.so static library file to your 
java bin folder.  

To run the base station java code, type for following:

   > cd base_station
   > java -jar BaseStation [port number]

where the port number is the port that the MSP430 is connected to. I have not
not been successfull in running this program in Windows.  In linux, the port
number is the device associated to the MSP430 found in the /dev folder.  When
trying to establish a serial connection with the MSP430 in Linux, I did have 
trouble connecting to the device as did many others on the internet.  To fix 
this you need to modify your usb driver to not drop the connection if a 
timeout occurs.  Follow the instructions in the file 
Connecting_To_MSP430_via_USB to fix this issue.

The current state of this code basically tracks the helicopter and plots its
location on a static Google Maps image.
